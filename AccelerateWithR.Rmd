- Implementation of fairly wide-spread business intelligence usage

--

- Promptly keeping up with new requirements (e.g. NWCCU disaggregation) https://www.csi.edu/institutional-effectiveness/institutional-research/data-at-a-glance/default.aspx

--

- Predictive analytics and implementation with stakeholders. 

--

- Beginning of data literacy training.

--

- Improving institution-wide data documentation.
